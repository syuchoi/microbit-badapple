W.I.P

I made this out of boredom.

This project does not import MIDI files, it is hardcoded by hand.

After the check icon is displayed, pressing the A button will play music.

The B button is a pause, but it's currently malfunctioning, so don't use it.

The A+B buttons are for simple debug purposes. I use them to check if I've written the track well.

Sometimes the music stops mid-play, which seems to be a limitation of the micro:bit's built-in speaker.

If several sounds are playing at the same time, the sound will cut in and out and eventually stop...
Honestly, I can't be bothered to figure out a more precise reason.
